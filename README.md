Segmantation folder includes both BiSeNetV2 and HRNETV2+OCR used for training. The instructions for re-training is same as that of the respective main repositories.
The pipline is configured for RUGD dataset in the repository. The pipeline for Rellis-3D and custom dataset will be updated soon.

Download pre-trained weights [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v9xzKUjP-9ydOSIMFAOy4fAUMRcpo1r-?usp=sharing).

The pretrained weights of RUGD dataset gave robust results from tests on custom dataset.\
The repository is stll under updation. Stay tuned.
